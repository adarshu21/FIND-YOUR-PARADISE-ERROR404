Challenge Overview
Find Your Paradise by weighing selected "quality of life" factors
Have you ever thought about building an application that can help people find places to live that maximize their quality of life and happiness?

The goal of this challenge is to analyze numerous datasets across different categories and make correlations with the data, using the HPCC Systems platform. After analyzing, the participants will be asked to design an interface to query this data and assign it a scoring system, then deliver it to the user via ROXIE and show the user where they should most likely want to live. Users should be given choices in an easy-to-use form that when submitted will generate a unique set of scores based on locations (Example: By State).

Every person’s definition of what make them happy can vary depending on several factors. To this challenge, we have narrowed these factors to four (4) categories: • Crime • Environment (Weather) • Health • Education

Crime – A dataset by US State with crimes between 2018-2021 is provided. Data points can include the number of crimes by State and Violent Crimes by State.

Climate – A dataset of Storm Data in the US over the last 10 years will be provided. Data Points can include number of storms by State, also injuries and fatalities due to a weather incident.

Health – A mortality rate by State from 1980 to 2020 dataset will be provided. Data points can include total mortality and/or average mortality by year and State.

Education – A dataset of the number of public and private schools by State will be provided. Data points include total school by State and percentage of Private Schools available to the Total Schools by State. Also, enrollment and student-to-teacher ratio can be a factor.
